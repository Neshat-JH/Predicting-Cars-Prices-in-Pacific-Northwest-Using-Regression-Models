# Predicting-Cars-Prices-in-Pacific-Northwest-Using-Regression-Models
Building a Price Predictive Model for Cars: A Regression Story!  The recent pandemic has shaken many industries including automakers. Due to limited production and trading in the past year and a half, there has been a shortage of parts, including semiconductors, which caused the price spikes and fluctuation in vehicles1! The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model for cars mainly for Pacific Northwest. The outcome of this predictive model is to help car buyers by providing some price insights based on the recent cars trading data from Seattle and Portland areas.
